/**
 * Defines how should java types {@link Long}, {@link BigDecimal} and {@link BigInteger} be serialized into JSON.
 * <p>
 * These types may contain values that are outside of IEEE754 64bit (double precision) range. A good interoperability
 * between different JSON generators and parsers can be achieved by constraining numbers outside of
 * IEEE754 64bit precision range to be serialized as string values.
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *  JSON_NUMBER:
 *    - Always serialize {@link Long}, {@link BigDecimal} and {@link BigInteger} as JSON number type.
 *
 *  JSON_STRING:
 *    - Always serialize {@link Long}, {@link BigDecimal} and {@link BigInteger} as JSON string type.
 *
 *  ADAPTIVE:
 *    - Check the value of {@link Long}, {@link BigDecimal} and {@link BigInteger}, if it is in IEEE754 64bit
 *    range serialize as JSON number, otherwise as JSON string.
 * </pre>
